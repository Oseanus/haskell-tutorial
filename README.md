# Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to explore concepts of funtional programming and what is better than the widely known functional programming language than Haskell. So I will fil this respository with life in an undefined time frame.

# Compiler Setup

The setup I use is on an Arch Linux machine. So I followed following [guide]{https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/haskell} for the installation.

It consists of two elements plus configuration:
- The Glasgow Haskell Compiler(GHC)
- Cabal - A build tool that relies on GHC

Another way to install is to use GHCup. This a commad line tool similar to rustup to manage different parallel Haskell installations.

# Editor Setup

As an editor I use  Visual Studio Code. I have installed folowing packages:

- Haskell - For language support and language server
- Haskell Syntax Highlighting
- haskell-linter
- Haskel GHCi Debug Adapter Phoityne
- haskell-build
